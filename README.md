 Project Overview

Garbage 2 Gold (G2G) is a revolutionary Web3 project aimed at solving the global e-waste crisis through a decentralized network of recycling units powered by the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). We are building a sustainable ecosystem that transforms electronic waste into valuable resources, incentivizing participation through tokenomics and NFTs.

Our Mission: To establish a globally scalable, decentralized e-waste management system that promotes a circular economy and reduces the environmental impact of electronic waste.

Key Features:

Decentralized Recycling Units (DRUs): Scalable recycling facilities deployed globally, capable of processing e-waste within a radius of 10,000 to 1,000,000 square kilometers, depending on population density and tier.

G2G Token (Governance & Equity): A governance token representing equity in the project, granting holders voting rights, early investor perks, and staking rewards based on project revenue.
E-WASTE Token (Utility): The ecosystem's transaction currency, used for all interactions within the G2G platform and for staking rewards.
Asset NFTs:** NFTs representing ownership and investment in specific DRUs, providing holders with revenue-sharing opportunities based on the unit's capacity (25 to 250,000 tons/day).
Equity NFTs: NFTs representing 2.5% equity in the project, granting holders governance rights and early investor perks.
Transparency & Tracking:** End-to-end tracking of e-waste from origin to final product using blockchain technology.
